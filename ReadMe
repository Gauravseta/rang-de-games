	1. Using Node.
	2.Using Tomcat.

 Steps on how to deploy using each way is given below.

*************** 1.  Steps to deploy using Node ******************

Note: I assume that Node and NPM are installed on your machine,If not then install both and then follow below steps.

1.Extract "CASTRepoProject.zip",Go to directory "CASTRepoProject".
2.Inside the directory,following files and folder should be visible.
   2.a.app folder
   2.b.gulpfile.js
   2.c.package.json.
   2.d.screenshots folder
3.If you are not at this hiererchy then make sure you are pointing at this level.
4.Open the command window at this level.
5.In command window run the following command "npm start".
6.It will download all dependencies and automatically open the Chrome Browser pointing to webapp.

Note: It is assumed that port "3000" is free while running this demo.If not then configure port available in "gulpfile.js"
	by replacing "3000" by the port number which is free.Final String will look like. e.g. var port="8081"; or var port="8082"; .

Note  :It is assumed that chrome browser is installed on machine,if not then install and follow above procedure. 

Note:If above procedure fails due to restricted access to download via NPM then follow Tomcat method to deploy the project.

**************** 2. Steps to Deploy this project using Tomcat *********

1.Extract "CASTRepoProject.zip",A directory with name "CASTRepoProject" would be created with all data.
2. Configure Tomcat on your local machine to run on <port>
3. paste the complete folder "CASTRepoProject" in "webapps" directory of tomcat folder.
4. After copying the folder to "webapps" directory of tomcat folder, test the project visually.
5. Hit the url "http://localhost:<port>/CASTRepoProject/app/index.html".
		Example:
		"http://localost:8080/CASTRepoProject/app/index.html"


Note: Check the above url correctly as index.html is inside "app" folder and not directly at the root level.








************* Known Issues ********************************

1.Given the API,response of the API is carefully observed and made full use of it.
2.Due to Time limitation,Look of the ui may not be good, but has tried to improvise as much possible.
3.Identation may not be proper due to IDE mismatch.Request to ignore at few, though atmost care is taken.
4.On selecting a repo on screen 2 from the bottom.e.g clicking on 8th listed repo. then on moving to screen 3, page will be automatically dragged downwards at the same where page at screen 2 was.
